				This game is a fork of the
				<a href="lasertag.html">Lasertag project</a> created
				specifically for Purdue University's student orientation event.
				It brings all the same tech, including live environment scanning
				and environment lighting effects, but swaps out the laser guns
				for voice-controlled magic wands.
			</p>
			<p>
				This isn't ready for public use (relying on a desktop operator
				program and fiducial marker setup), but I'll eventually merge
				the wand weapon back into the main game.
			</p>

			<h2>Features</h2>

			<a href="wizardtag/zap.png" target="_blank"
				><img src="wizardtag/zap.png"
			/></a>

			<p>
				Players yell one of three spells − fireball, lightning, or
				shield − and compete to score the most eliminations against the
				opposing team in two minutes.
			</p>

			<p>
				For spell speech recognition, I used
				<a href="https://alphacephei.com/vosk/" target="_blank"
					>Vosk ➔</a
				>, an on-device speech recognition model. While Vosk isn't as
				responsive as a bespoke wake-word model might be, latency is
				still low enough for spells to feel suitably responsive.
			</p>

				><img src="wizardtag/tag.png"
			/></a>

			<p>
				For instant and consistent spatial alignment, I used AprilTags.
				Each headset finds the best fit between its own noisy tag
				readings and corresponding known correct poses, spatially
				anchoring virtual elements like respawn points and aligning each
				player's coordinate space.
			</p>
			<p>
				For my purposes, this was faster and more robust than using
				Meta's spatial anchors, which sometimes fail to localize and are
				prone to drift over time.
			</p>

			<h2>Help from friends</h2>

				><img src="wizardtag/bgr poster.png"

			<p>
				Friends and I themed the event as a magic dueling class as part
				of a fictional Harry-Potter-esque wizarding school version of
				Purdue. I commissioned a friend (Keith) to draw this poster, and
				another (Alex) played the role of a wizard professor giving a
				'lecture' on spell casting and magic dueling.
			</p>

			<p>
				While I did everything on the developement side, the event
				itself would not have been a success without Alex, Keith,
				Andres, & Paige. Thank you guys so much for the hours you spent
				making this possible!
			</p>
