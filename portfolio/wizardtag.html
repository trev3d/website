				This game is a fork of
				<a href="lasertag.html">Lasertag</a> created for Purdue
				University's new student orientation. All of the tech in this
				game, such as the live envrionment scanning and environment
				lighting effects, comes from that project.

				Players yell one of three spells − fireball, lightning, or
				shield − and compete to score the most eliminations against the
				opposing team.

				I use
				<a href="https://alphacephei.com/vosk/" target="_blank"
					>Vosk ➔</a
				>, an on-device speech recognition model, to detect magic spell
				commands. While Vosk isn't as responsive as a bespoke wake-word
				model might be, latency is still low enough for spells to feel
				suitably responsive.

				I read AprilTags to spatially align headsets to the room and
				each other. Each headset finds the 'best fit' between their own
				tag readings against corresponding canonical poses, spatially
				anchoring virtual elements like respawn points and aligning each
				headset's coordinate space. This is faster and more robust than
				using Meta's spatial anchors, which are prone to drift over
				time.
