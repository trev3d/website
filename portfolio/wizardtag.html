				A fork of <a href="lasertag.html">Lasertag</a> created for
				Purdue University's student orientation event. Much of the
				technology in this game, such as the live envrionment scanning
				and lighting effects, is detailed there.

			<p>
				Players yell one of three spells ('fireball', 'lightning', or
				'shield') and compete to score the most elimintations against
				their opposing team. I use
				<a href="https://alphacephei.com/vosk/" target="_blank"
					>Vosk ➔</a
				>, an on-device speech recognition model/library, to detect
				spoken spells. While Vosk isn't as responsive as a bespoke
				'wake-work' model might be, latency is still low enough for the
				game to feel suitably responsive.
